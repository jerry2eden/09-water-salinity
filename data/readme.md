# Data

The CalCOFI data set represents the longest (1949-present) and most complete (more than 50,000 sampling stations) time 
series of oceanographic and larval fish data in the world. It includes abundance data on the larvae of over 250 species 
of fish; larval length frequency data and egg abundance data on key commercial species; and oceanographic and plankton 
data. The physical, chemical, and biological data collected at regular time and space intervals quickly became valuable 
for documenting climatic cycles in the California Current and a range of biological responses to them. CalCOFI research 
drew world attention to the biological response to the dramatic Pacific-warming event in 1957-58 and introduced the term
“El Niño” into the scientific literature.
